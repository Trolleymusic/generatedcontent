================

It's a plugin that brings CSS's `:after` and `:before` to browsers that don't support it.

It requires Modernizr and at the moment, still requires some CSS specific to the `div.after`/`div.before` created - unless all the CSS applied to the `:before` or `:after` element works on the browser you're targeting.
